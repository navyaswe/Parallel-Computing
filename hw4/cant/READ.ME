Homework 4
Due: Nov 23, 11:59 PM
----------
IMPORTANT NOTE:
There is something funky going on with the CUDA installation on Talapas.
To get this code correctly compiled, please set the cuda version to cuda/10.2 (i.e., module load cuda/10.2).
However, you may notice that the code is being compiled with nvcc from cuda/11.2.0.
This is because 11.2.0 is needed for A100 (compute capability 8.0) but the headers are not functioning correctly, so I'm using headers from 10.2.
Anyway, just use the provided Makefile after setting cuda version to cuda/10.2, and everything should compile fine.
I have also provided a .srun file to submit your GPU jobs.

Implement the SpMV kernel on a GPU.
This time, implement both CSR and ELLPACK/ITPACK (ELL) format as described 
in the document (Section 3.2):
https://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/77944/sc09-spmv-throughput.pdf

The function that needs implemented are:
1) convert_csr_to_ell
   This functions runs on the CPU and creates the appropriate ELL format on the
     CPU.
2) allocate_csr_gpu
   Allocate CSR data structure on the GPU and copy the necessary data from the 
     CPU to the GPU for execution.
3) spmv_kernel
   CSR SpMV kernel on the GPU - this function is called from the spmv_gpu 
     function which has already been implemented for you.
4) allocate_ell_gpu
   Allocate ELL data structure on the GPU and copy the necessary data from the 
     CPU to the GPU for execution
5) spmv_kernel_ell
   ELL SpMV kernel on the GPU - this function is called from the spmv_gpu_ell 
     function which has already been implemented for you.

Include a report that describes your findings. 
Try different # of threads and thread block sizes, as well as different implementations for the kernels (if you tried).


Things to note:
---------------
1) I have provided a skeleton code for you to use, as well as the function
   prototypes for functions you may require to implement SpMV on GPU.
   Read it carefully first.
   Search "COMPLETE THIS FUNCTION" to see what needs to be implemented.

2) GPU kernels and associated functions can be found in spmv.cu.

3) I provide a templated function CopyData - use this to copy data from the CPU
   to the GPU. If you do not use this, your performance numbers (i.e., GB/s) may
   be incorrect.

4) Email me with any questions if you are confused about anything.
